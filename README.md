# Advanced Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

Advanced Sorting Visualizer is a responsive, multi-page web application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms through animated visualizations. 
The project not only visually explains how each algorithm works but also provides real-time performance metrics and logging. 
It includes interactive features such as step-by-step execution, pseudocode highlighting, theme toggling (light/dark), and performance analytics using Chart.js.
